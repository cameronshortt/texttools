I know this code is terrible, but I wrote it a long
time ago and I don't really want to update it.

all - generate all possible combinations of length n
      from the given alphabet
e.g:  $ all abc 2
      aa
      ab
      ac
      ba
      bb
      bc
      ca
      cb
      cc

dot - move a dot through a word
e.g:  $ dot cool
      c.ool
      co.ol
      coo.l

gen - generate a word of length n with specified
      vowels or consonants.
e.g:  $ gen ccvc
      lkop
